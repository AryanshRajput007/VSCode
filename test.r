# Creating an array
# Suppose we want to create a 3-dimensional array with dimensions 2x3x4
# This will be a 3D array with 2 matrices, each having 3 rows and 4 columns

# Creating the array
my_array <- array(1:24, dim = c(2, 3, 4))

# Printing the array
print(my_array)

# # Accessing elements of the array
# # Suppose we want to access the element in the first row, second column, and third matrix
# element <- my_array[1, 2, 3]
# print(element)
